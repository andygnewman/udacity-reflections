Steps to create a Git
1. Create directory for the project (mkdir directory_name)
	Ensure any existing files are in there
2. Initialise Git (git init)
3. Check Git status (git status) - shows which branch you're in and what files are waiting to be added to commit.
4. Add files to staging area ready for a commit (git add filename)
